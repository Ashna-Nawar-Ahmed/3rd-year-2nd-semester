# Information Pool System
This is a website made using ASP.NET framework with MSSQL 
At present, there is an existence of sites with news from one source and sites that have blogs from various authors, but no site that contains both news from various sources side by side with blogs.This is the problem we aimed to solve with our project. The Information Pool System is an online-based web site that aspires to showcase news from various sites in one place. It aims to be the one-stop destination for people seeking information about current events of the world as well as find classifieds according to their requirements. It intends to become a single platform for both news articles and blogs posted by users, in order to provide impartial news to its users persistently.

Our website provides news, classifieds and blogposts, all in the same place

Demonstration of the project is given <a href="https://youtu.be/Ld0uILSJ1So">Here</a>.<br>
